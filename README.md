#### Title
The effect of Airbnb on housing prices

#### Abstract
This study examines the correlation between housing prices and the influence of Airbnb businesses, focusing on price and quantity. Using data from 50 provinces in Spain, an econometric model via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is applied to determine the significant influence of these variables. Main findings show a positive correlation: higher Airbnb prices and offers are associated with higher housing prices. Specifically, an increase in housing price per square meter is estimated at €1 for every 16 new Airbnb listings and €1.3 for every euro increase in Airbnb listing prices.

- Airbnb

#### Introduction
The study analyzes the impact of tourism on housing prices, particularly focusing on short-term rentals like Airbnb. The research aims to assess whether the increasing trend of short-term rentals has led to higher housing prices by reducing traditional rental housing supply or changing its economic returns. The study covers 50 Spanish provinces, excluding Ceuta and Melilla due to lack of data.

#### Literature Review
The review covers the volatility of the Spanish housing market, the effect of the 2008 economic crisis, and the recovery post-2016. It also discusses the impact of P2P rental platforms on rental prices, gentrification, and touristification, with specific examples from various cities in Spain and abroad.

#### Methodology and Data Sources
The study employs an econometric model using cross-sectional data from February 2022, collected via various methods including public administration sources, private reports, and web scraping. Variables include housing prices, traditional rental prices, Airbnb prices and offers, disposable income, consumer price index, mortgage interest rates, and secondary housing.

#### Results
The analysis finds a positive correlation between Airbnb variables (price and quantity) and housing prices. The study estimates that each new Airbnb offer increases housing prices by 6.38 cents per square meter, and each euro increase in Airbnb price results in a 1.35 euro increase in housing prices per square meter. The results underscore the significant impact of Airbnb on housing market dynamics.

#### Conclusion and Discussion
The study concludes that the proliferation of Airbnb listings and higher listing prices contribute to increased housing prices. Future research should consider seasonal variations and longitudinal data to better understand the trends.
